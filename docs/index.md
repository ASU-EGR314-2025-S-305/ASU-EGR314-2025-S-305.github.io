## Project Overview and Subsystems

### Team Project Description
The team project aims to design a STEM-themed interactive display system for K-12 students. It will consist of the following modular subsystems:
1. **Sensor Subsystem:** Includes a sensor that communicates via I2C or SPI.
2. **Actuator Subsystem:** Includes an actuator for bidirectional control and response.
3. **HMI Subsystem:** Implements push buttons and an OLED screen for user interaction.
4. **Communication Subsystem:** Ensures reliable UART communication and MQTT-based IoT connectivity.

### Individual Contributions:
- Each teammate will design and build their subsystem, including:
  - Block diagram, schematic, and PCB layout.
  - Software and API for UART communication.
  - Datasheet with detailed documentation.
