## **Introduction**
Our team recognized the importance of thoroughly understanding our challenge before diving into solutions. We needed to clearly define the goal of our exhibit—what message or concept we wanted to communicate—and identify who our audience would be. These foundational steps were critical to ensure that our efforts aligned with the needs and expectations of the visitors we aimed to engage. By focusing on fostering curiosity, learning, and meaningful interactions, we set the stage for designing an exhibit that could leave a lasting impression.

To move forward, we initiated a brainstorming session to generate potential solutions and features for our exhibit. Drawing inspiration from best practices in interactive exhibit design, we considered factors like intuitive controls, safety, accessibility, and engagement. Our goal was to explore a wide variety of ideas, encourage creativity, and develop concepts that could address both the needs of our audience and the unique challenges presented by our project. Through this process, we aimed to identify innovative and practical solutions to bring our vision to life.

## **Understanding the Exhibit**

Our exhibit aims to create an engaging, hands-on learning experience that allows visitors to explore fundamental STEM concepts interactively. The goal is to inspire curiosity and critical thinking by providing an intuitive, user-friendly experience that encourages visitors to experiment and understand key scientific principles. Through interactive demonstrations, we strive to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications, making learning both fun and educational.

Our primary audience includes K-12 students, educators, and families seeking to enhance their understanding of STEM concepts through interactive exhibits. The design of our exhibit takes into consideration factors such as varying age groups, cognitive abilities, and accessibility needs. For younger audiences, the interface will be simple and visually engaging, while older students and educators will benefit from deeper insights and advanced features. Ensuring safety, durability, and inclusivity is paramount, allowing all visitors to participate and gain meaningful insights from the experience.

## **Preparation**
The primary goal of our exhibit is to communicate a specific message or concept effectively through interactive engagement. Whether it’s magnifying an image, demonstrating a phenomenon, comparing objects, or encouraging cause-and-effect reasoning, the exhibit should allow visitors to explore and learn in a hands-on manner. Clear objectives help determine whether an interactive device is the best medium for conveying the desired information. The design should focus on fostering curiosity, learning, and enjoyment while providing memorable experiences for visitors.

The audience may vary widely, from young children to adults, and should be clearly defined during the planning phase. Whether targeting a specific age group, skill level, or interest, understanding the audience helps tailor the exhibit to their needs. For example, children between the ages of 6 and 10 may require simple, intuitive designs, while an exhibit for all ages would demand accessibility for people of varying physical sizes and abilities. Front-end evaluation helps identify the audience’s existing knowledge, interests, and misconceptions, enabling a more relevant and engaging experience for diverse visitors.

## # Brainstorming Process and Sorted Ideas

Our brainstorming sessions were structured to foster creativity and collaboration while addressing the diverse challenges of designing an effective and engaging exhibit. We utilized Lucidchart as a tool for documenting and organizing ideas in real-time. Through a series of structured sessions, we explored various aspects of the project to ensure a thorough and impactful ideation process. The key components of our approach included:

- **Brainstorming sessions**: Team members were encouraged to freely contribute ideas in a judgment-free and collaborative environment. We focused on generating a wide range of ideas, prioritizing quantity over quality during the initial phase to ensure unconventional and innovative concepts were considered.

- **SWOT analysis**: Each idea was evaluated using a framework to identify its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This process helped us refine our focus and prioritize ideas that were both practical and impactful.

- **Prototyping and feedback loops**: Rough prototypes were developed for selected concepts, and iterative feedback was collected. This allowed us to improve and refine ideas based on functionality, feasibility, and user engagement.

To begin the brainstorming process, we first discussed the major features and systems that would make our project both educational for the audience and a valuable learning experience for our team. From these discussions, we identified the need for multiple systems incorporating sensors, actuators, and human-machine interfaces (HMI). In addition, we emphasized the importance of safety and durability, instructional aids for better learning, and interactivity features to accommodate audiences with diverse abilities.

As a result, we aimed to generate at least 100 ideas covering the key areas of sensors, actuators, controls, and interactive features. This comprehensive approach helped us lay the foundation for a modular, user-friendly project design that could be further refined during the subsequent steps.
