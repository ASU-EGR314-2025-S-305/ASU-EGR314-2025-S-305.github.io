# Project Ideation and Concept Generation

## Introduction
Our team recognized the importance of thoroughly understanding our challenge before diving into solutions. We needed to clearly define the goal of our exhibit—what message or concept we wanted to communicate—and identify who our audience would be. These foundational steps were critical to ensure that our efforts aligned with the needs and expectations of the visitors we aimed to engage. By focusing on fostering curiosity, learning, and meaningful interactions, we set the stage for designing an exhibit that could leave a lasting impression.

To move forward, we initiated a brainstorming session to generate potential solutions and features for our exhibit. Drawing inspiration from best practices in interactive exhibit design, we considered factors like intuitive controls, safety, accessibility, and engagement. Our goal was to explore a wide variety of ideas, encourage creativity, and develop concepts that could address both the needs of our audience and the unique challenges presented by our project. Through this process, we aimed to identify innovative and practical solutions to bring our vision to life.
