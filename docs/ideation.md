## **Introduction**
Our team recognized the importance of thoroughly understanding our challenge before diving into solutions. We needed to clearly define the goal of our exhibit—what message or concept we wanted to communicate—and identify who our audience would be. These foundational steps were critical to ensure that our efforts aligned with the needs and expectations of the visitors we aimed to engage. By focusing on fostering curiosity, learning, and meaningful interactions, we set the stage for designing an exhibit that could leave a lasting impression.

To move forward, we initiated a brainstorming session to generate potential solutions and features for our exhibit. Drawing inspiration from best practices in interactive exhibit design, we considered factors like intuitive controls, safety, accessibility, and engagement. Our goal was to explore a wide variety of ideas, encourage creativity, and develop concepts that could address both the needs of our audience and the unique challenges presented by our project. Through this process, we aimed to identify innovative and practical solutions to bring our vision to life.

## **Understanding the Exhibit**

Our exhibit aims to create an engaging, hands-on learning experience that allows visitors to explore fundamental STEM concepts interactively. The goal is to inspire curiosity and critical thinking by providing an intuitive, user-friendly experience that encourages visitors to experiment and understand key scientific principles. Through interactive demonstrations, we strive to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications, making learning both fun and educational.

Our primary audience includes K-12 students, educators, and families seeking to enhance their understanding of STEM concepts through interactive exhibits. The design of our exhibit takes into consideration factors such as varying age groups, cognitive abilities, and accessibility needs. For younger audiences, the interface will be simple and visually engaging, while older students and educators will benefit from deeper insights and advanced features. Ensuring safety, durability, and inclusivity is paramount, allowing all visitors to participate and gain meaningful insights from the experience.

## **Preparation**
The primary goal of our exhibit is to communicate a specific message or concept effectively through interactive engagement. Whether it’s magnifying an image, demonstrating a phenomenon, comparing objects, or encouraging cause-and-effect reasoning, the exhibit should allow visitors to explore and learn in a hands-on manner. Clear objectives help determine whether an interactive device is the best medium for conveying the desired information. The design should focus on fostering curiosity, learning, and enjoyment while providing memorable experiences for visitors.

The audience may vary widely, from young children to adults, and should be clearly defined during the planning phase. Whether targeting a specific age group, skill level, or interest, understanding the audience helps tailor the exhibit to their needs. For example, children between the ages of 6 and 10 may require simple, intuitive designs, while an exhibit for all ages would demand accessibility for people of varying physical sizes and abilities. Front-end evaluation helps identify the audience’s existing knowledge, interests, and misconceptions, enabling a more relevant and engaging experience for diverse visitors.

## **Brainstorming Process**
Our brainstorming sessions were structured to foster creativity and collaboration while addressing the diverse challenges associated with designing an effective and engaging exhibit. We utilized Lucidchart, a versatile tool for documenting and organizing ideas in real time. Through a series of structured sessions, we explored various aspects of the project, including:

- Brainstorming sessions
  We encouraged team members to freely contribute ideas without judgment, fostering a collaborative and open environment. Following brainstorming best practices, we focused on generating a wide variety of ideas, prioritizing quantity over quality initially to ensure even unconventional ideas were considered.

- SWOT analysis
Each idea was evaluated using a SWOT framework to identify its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, helping us focus on practical and impactful solutions.
  
- Prototyping and feedback loops
Rough prototypes were created for selected concepts, and feedback was collected to refine and improve ideas through iterative design loops.

## Key Findings

From our brainstorming and analysis, the following ideas emerged as practical, impactful, and aligned with the goals of the project:

**Bernoulli Effect Demonstrator**
   - Concept: A hands-on exhibit where visitors can adjust airflow using fans and observe how objects like ping-pong balls levitate.
   - Audience Impact: Engages visitors by visualizing fluid dynamics in a fun, interactive way.

**Simple Weather Station**
   - Concept: A device that measures temperature, humidity, and light levels, with real-time display and internet connectivity.
   - Audience Impact: Helps students understand environmental monitoring and weather data through live sensor feedback and actuation.

**Self-Balancing Robot**
   - Concept: A robot that uses gyroscopes and motors to balance on two wheels, teaching feedback loops and stability.
   - Audience Impact: Demonstrates control systems in robotics, with options for user adjustments via a phone app.

**Line-Following Robot**
   - Concept: A robot that follows a drawn line on a surface, teaching pathfinding algorithms and sensor use.
   - Audience Impact: Simple to operate and visually engaging, allowing students to experiment with paths.

**Interactive LED Sound Visualizer**
   - Concept: A sound-activated LED matrix that displays patterns and waveforms based on sound input, visualizing the properties of sound waves.
   - Audience Impact: Combines audio and visuals to create an immersive STEM learning experience, teaching about frequency, amplitude, and waveforms.

Our group chose to create a this because it will show that.

## **Conclusion**
Conclude with the impact of these ideas on the project's development and future steps.
The goal of the project is to provide a device that can help teach students all types of sciences and give them a head start if they are heading
toward the engineering route. We are supposed to create an impact on the audience and help them engage in a STEM learning experience. The brainstorming of the devices that could help engage students can help show them a wide variety of STEM-related topics. The topics can range from understanding science topics better to a headstart toward robotics, and many other topics. These devices will also be very engaging so that users can easily figure out how they work. The goal is to provide a learning experience more than anything and help the user better understand the topic they are learning. As for the future
